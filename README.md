# Master Tom - Python Furry Discord Bot ðŸ¦Š

-------------------------------

Master Tom is an bot made for furry communities on Discord and made with Python.

-------------------------------

## Repository Information

-----------------------------------

The bot's code is completely open source and free to use as long as I am
credited. This section pretty much a tutorial on how to build this project on
Pycharm.

This project has not been tested on other code editors such as VSCode,
Sublime Text 3, etc.
However, this tutorial is for Pycharm.

### System Requirements

-----------------------------------

- Python 3.11 or greater (Must be added to PATH to use pip)
- Latest version of Pycharm Community Edition

### Installing Packages

-----------------------------------

Once you've downloaded the repository via cloning, 
go to command prompt and copy and paste the path to the **requirements.txt** file.

Then, input this command in. 

```pip install requirements.txt```

or if you prefer the long way, run these commands.

```pip install requests``` <- This should be preinstalled.

```pip install colorama``` <- This should be preinstalled.

```pip install py-cord``` <- REQUIRED TO RUN THIS PROJECT! DO NOT USE DISCORD.PY!

```pip install roblox``` <- Optional if you want Roblox features.

```pip install datetime``` <- This should be preinstalled.

```pip install pymongo``` <- Heavily recommended for MongoDB database support.

-----------------------------------


Wait for all packages listed in that file to install, once done,
open the project in Pycharm, go to config.py and copy-paste your Discord bot token.
And finally, launch your bot!

## Where to use the bot?

-----------------------------------

Due to Master Tom being in a early development stage, you can only use
the bot in The Sparklefur Den discord server. This is to prevent the bot being
spammed and ratelimited by Discord.

As soon as the bot exits out of the beta phase, the bot will be available to add in active servers only.
