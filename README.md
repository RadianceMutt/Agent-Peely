# Agent Peely - Python Discord Bot üçå

-------------------------------

Agent Peely is an bot made for furry and Fortnite communities on Discord and made with Python.

-------------------------------

## Repository Information

-----------------------------------

The bot's code is completely open source and free to use as long as I am
credited. This section pretty much a tutorial on how to build this project on
Pycharm.

This project has not been tested on other code editors such as VSCode,
Sublime Text 3, etc.
However, this tutorial is for Pycharm.

### System Requirements

-----------------------------------

- Python 3.11 or greater (Must be added to PATH to use pip)
- Latest version of Pycharm Community Edition

### Installing Packages

-----------------------------------

Once you've downloaded the repository via cloning, 
go to command prompt and copy and paste the path to the **requirements.txt** file.

Then, input this command in. 

```pip install requirements.txt```

or if you prefer the long way, run these commands. The ones with italic text are deprecated in the main bot.

```pip install requests``` <- Required for API powered features to work.

```pip install colorama``` <- Required for console text to be colourized

```pip install py-cord``` <- **Required to run the bot. Without this package, the bot will not run.**

```pip install roblox``` <- Optional if you want Roblox features. If you are going to add back the removed Roblox features, either launch the bot at your own risk or modify the file. To do that, put the `_roblox.py` file into the cogs folder.

```pip install datetime``` <- Required for time management to work.

```pip install pymongo``` <- Required for data saving to work.

```pip install fortnite_api``` <- Required for Fortnite features to work.

-----------------------------------


Wait for all packages listed in that file to install, once done,
open the project in Pycharm, go to config.py and copy-paste your Discord bot token.
And finally, launch your bot!

## Where to use the bot?

-----------------------------------

Due to Agent Peely being in a early development stage, you cannot add the bot to your servers.

As soon as the bot exits out of the beta phase, the bot will be available to add in active servers only.
